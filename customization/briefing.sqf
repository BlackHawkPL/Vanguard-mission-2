Delta 'Dog' Armor Company<br/>
Assault onto OBJ Rifles <br/>
0630<br/>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>

1.a.) Civilian Overview 
<br/>
<br/>The pre-dawn raids have sent the civilian population fleeing north or hiding inside houses. There should be zero civilian presence on the battlefield.

NEWTAB("A. Enemy Forces:")
Delta 'Dog' Armor Company<br/>
Assault onto OBJ Rifles <br/>
0630<br/>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>

1.b.) Enemy Forces overview.  The 101st MIBN continues to defend OBJ Rifles and OBJ Pistol. However, B/1-18’s raid disrupted their defensive posture and they were forced to displace the 3 x BMP-3 off of OBJ Pistol to reinforce interior lines.   A Mechanized Infantry Company (MIC) from the 101st MIBN is currently established in a hasty BP IVO OBJ Rifles. <br/>
<br/>
1.b.1.) Composition, Disposition and Strength.  Our Battalion will initially come in contact with an infantry platoon from the Brigade Recon Group acting as a forward recon element. Dismounted enemy reconnaissance assets, reinforced with GAZ Tigers, are oriented along the Avenues of approach in our Battalion AO oriented west-southwest. We currently have templated OP locations at 187122, 197121, 202128, and 207125. Confirmed T-90/BMP Mechanized Infantry Company is defending VIC OBJ Rifles.<br/>
<br/>
1.b.2.) Most Probable Course of Action.  Enemy reconnaissance will attempt to provide early warning, attrit friendly reconnaissance assets, identify the main effort and use their ATGM against our M1A2s, and defend in-depth with the MIC.<br/>
<br/>
1.b.3.) Most Dangerous Course of Action. Same as above except enemy will attempt to engage friendly forces with direct tank fires in conjuction with ATGM assets.<br/>
<br/>
1.b.4.) Forms of Contact:<br/>
OBSERVATION.  Enemy recon elements will have limited optics aside from what is provided by their ATGM systems and personal binoculars.<br/>
INDIRECT.  1 The MIC has 1 x 60mm mortar section (2km range) providing support to the their forward elements.<br/>
DIRECT.  The MIC uses BMP and T-90 fires to achieve standoff distance (2-3km) with attacking forces.  They also employ dismounted ATGM ambush teams (1-2km) to disrupt attacking forces and reduce the combat power of our attacking force.<br/>
OBSTACLES.  Tactical obstacles consisting of wire and surface laid AT mines are positioned 1500 to 2000m to the forward flanks of the MIC positions to disrupt attacking forces and canalize our movement into the center of the peninsula.  Surfaced laid AT mines were identified by friend UAVs and their position will form the Battalion’s left and right boundaries for our axis of advance.<br/>

1. Situation<br/>
1.c. Friendly<br/>
1.c.1.) BN Mission.  0630 1-18 IN attacks to seize OBJ Pistol in order to secure the town of Charkia and enable freedom of maneuver to follow-on Brigade forces.<br/>
<br/>
1.c.2.) Concept of Battalion Operation. The decisive point of this shaping operation is the establishment of Company-sized SBF VIC OBJ Rifles.  The Battalion will accomplish this by the BN Scouts conducting a Zone Recon from PL Jets to PL Patriots.  Once the zone recon is complete with enemy ATGM assets destroyed in zone, Dog Company will assault OBJ Rifles with Chaos Company conducting a follow and assume mission to establish a SBF on OBJ Rifles oriented north. The successful establishment of this SBF will enable freedom of maneuver for both Attack and Barbaric Company to assault and secure OBJ Pistol (Town of Charkia).<br/>
<br/>
1.c.3.) Adjacent Units. Battalion Scouts (Ghost Platoon) are already operating in sector to the north. Battalion Mortars joined Ghost Platoon and are currently establishing a mortar firing position (MFP) at MFP 1. All other Battalion forces are at AA Vanguard.<br/>

2. Company Mission:  Dog Company attacks to seize OBJ Rifles NLT D-1 1630 XXXX  in order to destroy enemy elements and CO establish SBF oriented to the north (see Annex 7). <br/>
ENDTAB;

NEWTAB("III. Execution:")
Notes on Execution:<br/>
- Dog Company’s ability to advance is limited by the progress of the scouts. In effect, you will conduct a tactical road march north based on front line trace of BN Scouts. Three conditions will dictate your Company commencing the assault: (1) Ghost Platoon has completed their mission and ATGM threats are destroyed, (2) Ghost Platoon is unable to complete OBJ due to combat losses and your Company will have to assault North anyway, or (3) 40 minutes has passed and the Scouts have run out of time.<br/>
<br/>
- Annex 1 contains a templated Zone Recon graphics and how they correspond to where your Company should be. The intent is to keep the tanks advancing forward as the scouts make progress in the zone recon. However, the tanks should not be coming into direct fire range of the ATGMs if the Scouts still have combat power/time to complete their mission.<br/>
<br/>
- There will be actual mines on the map. Do not direct your company into the AT mine threat. Stay within the templated CO boundary.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>1.a.) Civilian Overview:
<br/>
<br/> 1. Situation<br/>
1.a. Civilian: Local civilians are under a curfew. However, increasing discontent amoung the population has limited the curfew’s effectiveness. Friendly UAVs have spotted a few civilian vehicles driving at night.

Defense of BP Alpha<br/>
0630<br/>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
1.b.) Enemy Forces Overview:
<br/>
1.b.) Enemy Forces overview. A large enemy Company attacked AO Boris last night and destroyed critical supplies that we need for the defense of BP Alpha. The last friendly UAV with observation to the south of the International Boundary reported a Battalion movement of vehicles out of their motor pool and into a Battalion attack formation. Initial contact reports from our scouts occupying the distribution zone indicate a small enemy recon platoon of approximately 6 HMMWVs were seen 4km south of their OPs. <br/>
<br/>
1.b.1.) Composition, Disposition and Strength.  Our Battalion will initially come in contact with scout platoon from the their Battalion Headquarters who will act as a forward recon element. We expect to defend against a M1A2 tank company comprised of 13 tanks and a few service and support vehicles. <br/>
<br/>
1.b.2.) Most Probable Course of Action.  Enemy reconnaissance will attempt destroy the emplaced ATGM systems prepositioned in our disruption zone. After our ATGM capabilities are sufficiently reduced, they will attack with the Tank Company north across the international boundary and attempt to seize BP Alpha so they can control this key piece of terrain. <br/>
<br/>
1.b.3.) Most Dangerous Course of Action. Enemy recon element is able to destroy 100% of our ATGM capability in the distribution zone and make visual contact with defending forces on BP Alpha. Enemy forces will conduct battle hand over and attacking enemy armor threat will know our exact disposition on the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
1.b.4.) Forms of Contact:<br/>
OBSERVATION.  Enemy recon elements will have limited optics aside from what is provided by their ATGM systems and personal binoculars.<br/>
INDIRECT.  1 The Enemy CAB has 1 x 60mm mortar section (2km) providing support to the their forward elements.<br/>
DIRECT.  The enemy tank company M1A2 achieves accurate standoff fire from a distance of 2-3km with defending forces.  <br/>

1.c.1.) 101 Mechanized Infantry Battalion (MIBN) Mission:
<br/>
1.c.1.) 101 Mechanized Infantry Battalion (MIBN) Mission.  The 101st MIBN continues to defend in-depth along the international boundary. Our recon mission early this morning has severely impacted the enemy’s forces as they lost their M3A3s and their recon forces only have HMMWV platforms. A/101 is continuing to defend BP Alpha and the forward disruption zone. C/101 is defending BP Charlie.<br/>
<br/>
1.c.2.) Concept of A/101 MIBN Defense Mission.  The decisive point of this mission is the successful destruction of the enemy recon force with our recon force. The destruction of the enemy recon force will force the enemy to commit their tanks to the attack with limited intelligence and anti-ATGM capabilities. A/101 will continue to hold their armor assets at BP Alpha and prepare for enemy attack and be prepared for a counter-attack.<br/>
<br/>
1.c.3. Adjacent Units: C/101 is continuing to defend BP Charlie to the northwest and B/101 is continuing to guard AO Boris to the north.<br/>
<br/>
1.c.4. Supporting Units: None.<br/>

NEWTAB("II. Mission:")
2.) Company Mission: A/101 defend in-depth in order to destroy enemy recon platoon and an enemy tank company.<br/>
ENDTAB;
NEWTAB("III. Execution:")
Notes on Execution: <br/>
- There will be a 5 minute setup timer for both sides. Neither side will be able to move more than 100m outside their initial setup zone. <br/>
- A/101 must remain north of the international boundary (they cannot move south of the town of Dorida). Their east and west limit of advance is the engagement zone. <br/>
- The Company Commander can preposition his recon elements in groups of 3 (1 x vix, 5 x pax). <br/>
- The Company Commander will be able to preposition his armor platoons. <br/>
- You will observe Geneva conventions and refrain from engaging the MEDEVAC M113. However, M113 must not be used for transportation of non-wounded or it loses Geneva protections.
